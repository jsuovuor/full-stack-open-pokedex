The language which I chose for researching for this exercise is Java. With quick googling I found several different linting tools for Java. According to multiple sources some common linting tools for Java are Checkstyle, Lightrun and PMD. It does not come as a surpirse that there are a lot of testing tools also for Java. For unit testing in Java one could use for example JUnit. JUnit is a very popular tool to be used with Java and multiple IDEs also have integration with JUnit so one could run tests locally before sending code through the deployment pipeline. For end-to-end tests with Java it was a bit more tough to find information but I came across an API called flue2ent which apparently could be used with end-to-end testing with Java. A building tool can be used to automate the process of compiling, assembling and deploying of the application. Apache Maven is an open source build tool which is often used with small teams. This could be an ideal build tool for the 6 people team.

There are alternatives for GitHub actions. For example Travis CI is a possible pick for CI tool. There seems to be multiple guides how to set up Travis CI with the Apache Maven build tool. Therefore with the information I currently have I would choose Travis CI as an alternative for GitHub actions.

Considering the team size and that the app hasnâ€™t been deployed yet I would choose the setup to be hosted in a cloud-based environment. Once the app would be deployed and maybe with a larger team in future I would consider the app to be self-hosted. For this question one should consider the build time of the application and what is the future for the application and the team.
